LuaTeX-ja is a macro package for typesetting Japanese documents with LuaTeX.
This package is highly affected by ASCII pTeX engine, but not a porting of it.

Note that this package is still *alpha-stage*; documentations are not complete
and specifications are subject to change. Documentations are located at
  doc/man-en.pdf (en), doc/man-ja.pdf (ja), doc/manual-zh.pdf (zh).

LuaTeX-ja is developed on
  <http://sourceforge.jp/projects/luatex-ja/wiki/FrontPage(en)>.
If you have questions/requests/bugs, please contact the project members via
links found in the page above. 



Installation
------------

0. Please make sure that your TeX distribution is up-to-date. 
   Needed (additional) packages are:
   - xunicode.sty v0.981
   - filehook.sty
1. If you use TeX Live 2011 or later, you can install LuaTeX-ja via tlmgr.
2. If you must/want to install manually:
   a. Download the source archive from CTAN, or HEAD in the Git repository by
      <http://git.sourceforge.jp/view?p=luatex-ja/luatexja.git
                                                    ;a=snapshot;h=HEAD;sf=tgz>
   b. Extract the archive and put src/ into your TEXMF tree.
      An example location is TEXMF/tex/luatex/luatexja.
   c. Files in src/no_runtime/ are not used in the regular use, 
      so you can remove them.
   d. You may need to update the filename database, by 'mktexlsr' or something.


Basic Usage
-----------

LuaTeX-ja supports both the plain format and LaTeX2e.
Simply loading luatexja.sty by \input or \usepackage does the minimal setting.

- If you want to create Japanese-based documents, you can consider the use of 
  ltj{article,book,report}.cls or ltjs{article,book}.cls.
- If you want to use the fontspec package, please load luatexja-fontspec.sty.
  It defines control sequences such as \setmainjfont, setsansjfont and 
  \jfontspec, which can be used for specifying Japanese fonts.
