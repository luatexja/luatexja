The LuaTeX-ja Package $VER$

LuaTeX-ja is a macro package for typesetting Japanese documents with LuaTeX.
This package is highly affected by ASCII pTeX engine, but not a porting of it.

Note that this package is still *alpha-stage*; documentations are not complete
and specifications are subject to change. Documentations are located at
  doc/luatexja-en.pdf (en), doc/luatexja-ja.pdf (ja).
These documents are generated from doc/luatexja.{dtx,ins}. However,
to produce PDF files, you will need Kozuka fonts (commercial fonts).

LuaTeX-ja is developed on
  <http://sourceforge.jp/projects/luatex-ja/wiki/FrontPage(en)>.
If you have questions or recognize bugs/have feature requests,
we would like you to create a thread in the forum or a ticket
in the way which SourceForge.JP supplies, via links found in
the page above.


Installation
------------

0. Please make sure that your TeX distribution is up-to-date.
   This version of LuaTeX-ja requires 
    - LuaTeX beta-0.74.0 or later
    - luaotfload v2.2
    - luatexbase v0.6
   Hence this version does not work in TeX Live 2012 (or earlier).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2013 or later, you can install LuaTeX-ja via tlmgr.

2. If you must/want to install manually:

   a. Download the source archive from CTAN,
      or tagged as $VER$ in the Git repository by
      <http://git.sourceforge.jp/view?p=luatex-ja/luatexja.git
                              ;a=snapshot;h=refs/tags/$VER$;sf=tgz>

   b. Extract the archive and process following three files by LuaLaTeX
      to generate classes for Japanese typesetting:
        src/ltjclasses.ins
        src/ltjltxdoc.ins
        src/ltjsclasses.ins

   c. Put src/ into your TEXMF tree.
      An example location is TEXMF/tex/luatex/luatexja.

      If you are updating from old version, you MUST remove it before
      extracting the new version of LuaTeX-ja.

   d. You may need to update the filename database, by 'mktexlsr' or something.


Basic Usage
-----------

LuaTeX-ja supports both the plain format and LaTeX2e.
Simply loading luatexja.sty by \input or \usepackage does the minimal setting.

- If you want to create Japanese-based documents, you can consider the use of
  ltj{article,book,report}.cls or ltjs{article,book}.cls.
- If you want to use the fontspec package, please load luatexja-fontspec.sty.
  It defines control sequences such as \setmainjfont, setsansjfont and
  \jfontspec, which can be used for specifying Japanese fonts.
