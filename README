The LuaTeX-ja Package $VER$

LuaTeX-ja is a macro package for typesetting Japanese documents with LuaTeX.
This package is highly affected by ASCII pTeX engine, but not a porting of it.

Note that this package is still *alpha-stage*; documentations are not complete
and specifications are subject to change. Documentations are located at
  doc/luatexja-en.pdf (en), doc/luatexja-ja.pdf (ja).

LuaTeX-ja is developed on
  <https://github.com/luatexja/luatexja>.
If you have questions or recognize bugs/have feature requests,
we would like you to create an issue.


Installation
------------

0. Please make sure that your TeX distribution is up-to-date.
   This version of LuaTeX-ja requires
    - LuaTeX 1.10.0 (or later)
    - luaotfload (v3.1 or later recommended)
    - adobemapping (Adobe CMap files)
    - LaTeX2e 2020-02-02 patch level 5 or later (if you want to use with LaTeX)
    - etoolbox package
    - ltxcmds package, pdftexcmds package
    - filehook package, atbegshi package (for LaTeX2e 2020-02-02)
    - everysel package (for LaTeXe 2020-02-02 and 2020-10-01)
    - Harano Aji fonts (https://github.com/trueroad/HaranoAjiFonts)
	  more specifically, HaranoAjiMincho-Regular and HaranoAjiGothic-Medium

   Using LuaTeX-ja with LuaHBTeX is not well tested.
   One might be able to typeset documents without an error, but with
   some unwanted results.

1. If you are using TeX Live 2021, you can install LuaTeX-ja via tlmgr.

2. If you must/want to install manually:

   a. Download the source archive from CTAN,
      or tagged as $VER$ in the Git repository by
      <https://github.com/luatexja/luatexja/archive/refs/tags/$VER.zip>

   b. Extract the archive and process following three files by LuaLaTeX
      to generate classes for Japanese typesetting:
        src/ltjclasses.ins
        src/ltjltxdoc.ins
        src/ltjsclasses.ins

   c. Put src/ into your TEXMF tree.
      An example location is TEXMF/tex/luatex/luatexja.

      If you are updating from old version, you MUST remove it before
      extracting the new version of LuaTeX-ja.

   d. You may need to update the filename database, by mktexlsr (or by another program).


Basic Usage
-----------

LuaTeX-ja supports both the plain format and LaTeX2e.
Simply loading luatexja.sty by \input or \usepackage does the minimal setting.

- If you want to create Japanese-based documents, you can consider the use of
  ltj{article,book,report}.cls or ltjs{article,book,report}.cls.
- If you want to use functionality of the fontspec package with Japanese fonts,
  load luatexja-fontspec.sty. It defines control sequences such as \setmainjfont,
  \setsansjfont and  \jfontspec, which can be used for specifying Japanese fonts.

Notes
-----
* We don't recommend defining a Japanese font with HarfBuzz, by specifying
  "Renderer=..." (fontspec) or "mode=harf" (otherwise).

* This archive contains four .{dtx,ins} pairs:
    src/ltjclasses.{ins,dtx},  src/ltjltxdoc.{ins,dtx}
    src/ltjsclasses.{ins,dtx}, doc/luatexja.{ins,dtx}
  Former three pairs generate class files (see above),
  while the latter doc/luatexja.{ins,dtx} generates documentations.
  (You will need Kozuka fonts to regenerate documentaion PDFs.)

  No .{dtx,ins} pair generates .sty files of LuaTeX-ja package.

* src/*.{ins.dtx} are not needed in regular use.

* ltj-kinsoku_make.tex is removed in version 20200808.0.
  This file and ltj-kinsoku.lua are not used anymore.
  (Do not remove ltj-kinsoku.tex.)
